- Observations: (null)

## Flags

- `%c` print a single character.
- `%s` print a string of characters.

- `%d` print a decimal (base 10) number.
- `%i` print an integer in base 10.
- `%u` print an unsigned decimal (base 10) number

- `0` left-pads the number with zeroes (0) instead of spaces when padding is specified.
- `.` the precision in not specified in the format string, but as an additional integer value argument preceding the argument that has to be formated.
- `#` used with x or X specifiers the value is preceeded with 0x or 0X respectively for the values different than zero.

## P.S.

This project is estimated that it takes about 175 hours, and I do it in less than a day because I accidentally set a deadline, so please be gentile with my code :")
